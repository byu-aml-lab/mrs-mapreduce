# TODO

The following items are the most urgent:

- Allow datasets to be accessed over HTTP.  Whether to use NFS or HTTP should
  be configurable.  Also, make a distinction between saving data somewhere
  permanent vs. saving it temporarily on NFS.  Automatically decide when to
  save such data.  Auto-delete temporary data from NFS and memory once it's no
  longer needed.

- Allow HDFS and WebDAV to be used for shared storage.
