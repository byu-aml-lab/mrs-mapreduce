MapReduce Simple (Mrs)

Mrs is a simple MapReduce implementation.

# TODO

The following items are the most urgent:

- Allow datasets to be accessed over HTTP.  Whether to use NFS or HTTP should
  be configurable.  Also, make a distinction between saving data somewhere
  permanent vs. saving it temporarily on NFS.  Automatically decide when to
  save such data.  Auto-delete temporary data from NFS and memory once it's no
  longer needed.

- Convert XMLRPC (both client and server) to use Twisted.  Put all Twisted
  stuff into a single thread.

- When sending URLs around, send (partition id, url) pairs instead of a list
  of URLs.  This will be more friendly for sparse lists and gradually updated
  lists.
