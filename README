MapReduce Simple (Mrs)

Mrs is a simple MapReduce implementation.


POSIX MapReduce:

- shared storage are on an NFS volume
- ssh to each machine and start up the same program as posix-slave
- the slave listens on a public port, daemonizes, and returns the port #
- or does the ssh session stay open???  SSH sessions can automatically close,
  so that might not be a good idea.  On the other hand, you get automatic
  encryption, etc.
