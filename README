Introduction to Mrs
===================

The name Mrs might stand for MapReduce Simplified, or MapReduce
Straightforward, or MapReduce Spartan.  Something that starts with S,
anyway.  Mrs is a MapReduce implementation that aims to be easy to use
and efficient.  We have tried to avoid reinventing the wheel.  Lots of
other people have written job schedulers, so we don't include a job
scheduler.  Other people have written network protocols, so we use
those.  We aren't smart enough to outsmart everybody else.

To learn about the MapReduce programming model, we suggest you begin by
reading the MapReduce paper at http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html.
We generally do things as described in the paper.  In examples/wordcount.py,
we show our version of the WordCount MapReduce program described in the paper.
We think it's pretty.

You may also find helpful the Installation instructions and tutorials we have
included in the tutorials folder.
