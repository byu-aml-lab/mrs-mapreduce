- RPC over HTTPS
- logging
- pass a dict of options from the application to the slaves
- simplify job specification with an app_spec and job_spec (?)
- improve the way you give a Job its operations list
- do input splitting
- use the "Range:" header in HTTP requests as part of the split
  implementation.  See also the "urlgrabber" module.  To implement this in the
  HTTP server, you will have to implement do_GET on its own (see
  http://techlists.org/archives/programming/pythonlist/2002-02/msg04678.shtml)

Calling C Mappers and Reducers:

Use ctypes and create a callback function: emit.  From C's perspective:

void emit(char *key, char *value);

Pass the C function the key (as a c_char_p), the list of values (probably as a
char **), and a function pointer to emit.  Or something like that.
