- speculative execution
- the done call should have some identifier of which job is being finished
  in order to reduce possible confusion; once this is done, the slave can
  retry calling done
- add an input splitter; use the "Range:" header in HTTP requests as part of
  the split implementation.  See also the "urlgrabber" module.  To implement
  this in the HTTP server, you will have to implement do_GET on its own (see
  http://techlists.org/archives/programming/pythonlist/2002-02/msg04678.shtml)
- show current status by creating an HTTP server on the master (with an
  option)
- have reducers start collecting data before all of the input files are ready
- find something more sane than Twisted (something generator based would be
  really nice)

# TODO

The following items are the most urgent:

- Allow datasets to be accessed over HTTP.  Whether to use NFS or HTTP should
  be configurable.  Also, make a distinction between saving data somewhere
  permanent vs. saving it temporarily on NFS.  Automatically decide when to
  save such data.  Auto-delete temporary data from NFS and memory once it's no
  longer needed.

- Allow HDFS and WebDAV to be used for shared storage.

########################################################################

Calling C Mappers and Reducers:

Use ctypes and create a callback function: emit.  From C's perspective:

void emit(char *key, char *value);

Pass the C function the key (as a c_char_p), the list of values (probably as a
char **), and a function pointer to emit.  Or something like that.


========================================================================

TO TRY:
- -R :number of reduce tasks
- Multiple slaves (both less and more than six)
- ssh to sage
- mrs-potato.py


TODO
- Default --mrs-local-shared (slave): mkdtmp /tmp (e.g. /tmp/mrs-slave.xyz)
  slave.py
- Slave didn't quit
- Wordcount tutorial: serial, master/slave(s), mrs-potato
- Simple program tutorial
- Graceful exit for bad file in both run modes
- Slave should ping master and timeout after x seconds
- SocketServer error on home computer when running parallel?
