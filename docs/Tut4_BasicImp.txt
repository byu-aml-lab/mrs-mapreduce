Tutorial #4 

Writing your own mrs implimentation.

The wordcount implementation that we have been working with throught the previous
three tutorials is designed to be a simple way to get you comfortable with mrs. 
However, your projects may requier useing some of the more advanced features of
mrs, so in this final tutorial we will try to introduce some of them to help you
get started on your own projects.

 




Your Mrs MapReduce program might look something like this:

class Program(mrs.MapReduce):
    def map(key, value):
        yield newkey, newvalue

    def reduce(key, values):
        yield newvalue

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import mrs
    mrs.main(mapper, reducer)
