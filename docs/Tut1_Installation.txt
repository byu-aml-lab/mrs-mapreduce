Tutorial #1 



Installing Mrs

Mrs is a lightweight but highly scalable implementation of the well known
MapReduce programing paradigm developed at Google. It is written entirely in
Python and was designed for ease of use in such areas as research and education
where the larger and more complex implementations, such as Hadoop, are not needed.



Things to consider before beginning:

    -Mrs is written in Python, so you will need to have it installed before
     trying to install Mrs.



Three minute, three step, installation instructions:

If you are familiar with the Linux environment, you should have no difficulty
installing Mrs and running it with the example program in three minutes or less.

    1. Using Git, clone the repository from git://aml.cs.byu.edu/mrs.git,
       or if you prefer, download and unpack the tar file available from
       http://code.google.com/p/mrs-mapreduce/.

       example: $ git clone git://aml.cs.byu.edu/mrs.git

    2. Navagate to the MRS_HOME folder and run setup.py as root (see note below
       if you don't have root access)*.

       example: $ sudo python setup.py install

    3. Verify correct instalation by running the provided wordcount program,
       from the MRS_HOME/examples directory, passing it an input text file and
       an output directory name.

       example: $ python wordcount.py myTextFile.txt myOutputDir

If all went well you should have a file called source_something_something.mtxt
in your output directory containing a list of all the words in the text file
with their respective counts. Further tutorials to help get started running Mrs
in parallel, creating a run-script, and an introduction to some of the more
advanced features have been included in the MRS_HOME/docs folder. You may find
these helpful as you begin applying Mrs to your own problems.



* What to do if you don't have root access:

If you don't have root access, or for whatever reason don't want to run the
install, it's not a big problem, you just have to add the MRS_HOME directory
to your python path variable. For example, to add MRS_HOME to your python path
variable, you could use the 'export' command as follows:

    example: $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/path_from_home_dir_to_MRS_HOME/

You can do this each time you log in and run Mrs, or you can modify your
terminal configuration file to automatically do it for you. So, if you're
using bash, for example, you would just add the example line to your .bashrc
file.
