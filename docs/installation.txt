.. _installing_mrs:

If you are familiar with Python and the Linux environment, you should have no
difficulty installing Mrs and running it with the example wordcount program in
three minutes or less.


Prerequisites
=============

Mrs is supported on Linux and Mac OS.  It is not currently supported
on Windows, although this may change in the future.

The only mandatory prerequisite for Mrs is `Python <http://python.org/>`_,
which is already installed on most Linux and Mac OS systems.  Mrs does not
rely on any libraries outside the Python Standard Library.  However, the
following optional utilities can be very helpful when running Mrs in parallel:

- `pssh <http://code.google.com/p/parallel-ssh/>`_

- `screen <http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/>`_ (most Linux distributions
  already have this installed)


Option 1: Install Automatically
===============================

With pip
--------

If you have pip `(homepage) <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_::

    $ pip install mrs --user

If you want pip and don't have it check out `their installation page
<http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_.

With easy_install
-----------------

If you have easy_install `(setuptools homepage)
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::

    $ easy_install mrs

**Awesome!** Now you can check out the :doc:`tutorial`

Next Steps
----------

- Check out the :doc:`tutorial`
- Read the :doc:`user_guide`
- Loot at some examples :doc:`user_guide/examples`

Option 2: Install Manually
==========================

Step 1: Download
----------------

Download and unpack the tar file from the
`Mrs Downloads <http://code.google.com/p/mrs-mapreduce/downloads/list>`_
page or use `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ to clone the repository::

    $ git clone https://code.google.com/p/mrs-mapreduce/ && cd mrs-mapreduce

.. FIX: is there a way to link to the latest zipball?

Step 2: Install
---------------

The ``mrs`` module must be on the Python path to be usable.  There are two
options for how to do this:

Method 1: Install as a python module (recommended)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

Method 2: Put it manually on your path (if you want to hack on mrs)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you don't know what this is, you should probably `read up about it
<https://www.google.com/search?q=modify+pythonpath+bashrc>`_. If you don't
want to, you might get away with running the following command
``echo export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH`pwd`>>~/.bashrc`` and then ``.
~/.bashrc`` to reload your bash config. But it's really a good idea to get to
know your config files, so you should just read up on it.

Step 3: Run WordCount to Verify the Installation
------------------------------------------------

Verify correct installation by running the example WordCount program, passing
it an input text file and an output directory name. For example, if you wanted
to run WordCount on this tutorial, you would run ::

    $ python examples/wordcount.py ./docs/installation.txt tutorial_outdir

If all went well you should have a file called source_something_something.mtxt
in your output directory containing a list of all the words in the text file
with their respective counts, sorted alphabetically.

Troubleshooting
===============

Errors running setup.py
-----------------------

If you have problems running setup.py, you probably don't have setuptools
installed. To install it, run the following line: ::

    $ wget 'http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py' && sudo python ez_setup.py

Other Problems
--------------

With any other installation problems, please post a question to the
`Mrs Mailing List <http://groups.google.com/group/mrs-mapreduce>`_.
