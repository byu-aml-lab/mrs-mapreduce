If you are familiar with Python and the Linux environment, you should have no
difficulty installing Mrs and running it with the example wordcount program in
three minutes or less.

If you encounter any problems not addressed in this guide, please post a
question to the
`Mrs Mailing List <http://groups.google.com/group/mrs-mapreduce>`_.


Prerequisites
=============

Mrs is supported on Linux and Mac OS.  It is not currently supported
on Windows, although this may change in the future.

The only mandatory prerequisite for Mrs is `Python <http://python.org/>`_,
which is already installed on most Linux and Mac OS systems.  Mrs does not
rely on any libraries outside the Python Standard Library.  However, the
following optional utilities can be very helpful when running Mrs in parallel:

- `pssh <http://code.google.com/p/parallel-ssh/>`_

- `screen <http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/>`_ (most Linux distributions
  already have this installed)


Option 1: Install Automatically
===============================

Many users may find it easiest to use pip or easy_install to install Mrs.

With pip
--------

If you have `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_, you can use it
to install Mrs automatically::

    $ pip install mrs --user

If you want pip and don't have it check out `their installation page
<http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_.

With easy_install
-----------------

If you don't have pip, you can use `easy_install
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ to install Mrs automatically::

    $ easy_install mrs


Option 2: Install Manually
==========================

If you don't want to use an automatic tool, you can install Mrs manually.

Step 1: Download
----------------

You may either download a tar file or clone with Git.  To use the tar file,
download and unpack it from the `Mrs Downloads
<http://code.google.com/p/mrs-mapreduce/downloads/list>`_ page.
Alternatively, you may use `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ to clone the
repository::

    $ git clone https://code.google.com/p/mrs-mapreduce/ && cd mrs-mapreduce

.. FIX: is there a way to link to the latest zipball?

Step 2: Install
---------------

The ``mrs`` module must be on the Python path to be usable.  You may either
install Mrs system-wide or use it in place without installing.

If you choose to install Mrs system-wide, run the following command as root::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

If you choose not to install Mrs system-wide with setup.py, then you must add
the ``mrs-mapreduce`` directory to your Python path to ensure that Python can
find the ``mrs`` module.  Set and export the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment
variable in your ``.bashrc`` file (or the equivalent for other shells).  It's
best to make sure you understand how the `.bashrc file
<http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/dotfiles/bashrc.html>`_ works, but you
might get away with running the following command ``echo export
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH`pwd`>>~/.bashrc`` and then ``. ~/.bashrc`` to reload
your bash config.


Next Steps
==========

Verify correct installation by running the example WordCount program, passing
it an input text file and an output directory name. For example, if you wanted
to run WordCount on this tutorial, you would run ::

    $ python examples/wordcount.py ./docs/installation.txt tutorial_outdir

If all went well you should have a file called source_something_something.mtxt
in your output directory containing a list of all the words in the text file
with their respective counts, sorted alphabetically.
