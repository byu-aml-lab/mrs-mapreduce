Mrs MapReduce Documentation
===========================

Mrs (pronounced "missus") is a lightweight implementation of MapReduce.  The
name derives from the practice of referring to MapReduce programs by the title
"mister" (e.g., "Mr. Wordcount").  The name "Mrs" is a natural variation on
"Mr" and more memorable than an arbitrary acronym.

Mrs is a MapReduce implementation that aims to be easy to use and reasonably
efficient.  It is written in Python and where possible builds on existing
solutions to remain lightweight.  Python 2 (>=2.6) and Python 3 are supported.
Mrs is licensed under the GNU GPL.

The `MapReduce paper <http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html>`_ provides
an introduction to MapReduce.  The `examples/wordcount.py
<http://code.google.com/p/mrs-mapreduce/source/browse
/examples/wordcount.py>`_ file shows the Mrs WordCount based on the
corresponding program described in the paper.

* the `Mrs project page <http://code.google.com/p/mrs-mapreduce/>`_ (for bug reports and enhancement requests)

* the `Mrs mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/mrs-mapreduce>`_ (for questions and discussion)
