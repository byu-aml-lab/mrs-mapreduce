Welcome to the Mrs-MapReduce Documentation page!
================================================

Mrs (pronounced "missus") is a lightweight but scalable implementation of the
well known MapReduce programming paradigm developed at Google. It is written
entirely in Python and was designed for ease of use in such areas as research
and education where the larger more complex implementations, such as Hadoop,
are not needed.

The name Mrs might stand for MapReduce Simplified, or MapReduce
Straightforward, or MapReduce Spartan.  Something that starts with S,
anyway.  Mrs is a MapReduce implementation that aims to be easy to use
and efficient.  We have tried to avoid reinventing the wheel.  Lots of
other people have written job schedulers, so we don't include a job
scheduler.  Other people have written network protocols, so we use
those.  We aren't smart enough to outsmart everybody else.

To learn about the MapReduce programming model, we suggest you begin by
reading the `MapReduce paper <http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html>`_
published by Google. We generally do things as described in the paper.  
In `examples/wordcount.py <http://code.google.com/p/mrs-mapreduce/source/browse
/examples/wordcount.py>`_, we show our version of the WordCount MapReduce
program described in the paper. We think it's pretty.
