Tutorial #2


The Run-Script

This tutorial explaines the example run-script include in MRS_HOME/examples. The
script is also written in Python and uses screen and pssh to control the master
and slaves. 

 fulton.py is a script we've used to submit MapReduce jobs to Brigham
Young University's Fulton Supercomputing Lab. It is included just as a helpful
example.
